Record GPS position on an android device using qpython
Interval can be changed using INTERVAL_SECONDS

On the roadmap:
- database can be accessed from a computer, however it would be nice to have a mechanism to push the data to a remote server  
- Make a GUI which controls the GPSRecorder
- Save data in a standard GPS log data format, to be used by third-party software
- Dashboard to display the recorded data
